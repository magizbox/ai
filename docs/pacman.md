# The Pac-Man Projects

Today I found an interesting AI project - <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html" target="_blank">The Pac-Man</a>

Here is the project overview

<blockquote><strong>The Pac-Man projects</strong> were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as <strong>informed state-space search</strong>, <strong>probabilistic inference</strong>, and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

We designed these projects with three goals in mind. The projects allow students to<strong> visualize the results of the techniques</strong> they implement. They also contain code examples and clear directions, but do not force students to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.

In our course, these projects have boosted enrollment, teaching reviews, and student engagement. The projects have been field-tested, refined, and debugged over multiple semesters at Berkeley. We are now happy to release them to other universities for educational use.</blockquote>

In the next part of this post, I will show my works on this project
